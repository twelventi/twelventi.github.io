This website is my personal technical blog and resume site. Hopefully I have some interesting blog posts, but I'll be excited if even one person reads them. I'm working on adding projects to my [github](https://github.com/twelventi), and also finding interesting topics to write blog posts about. My first post and the inspiration for this site came from me hosting an event for the Fordham Computer Science Society, wherein we hacked a WiFi enabled "smart" coffee maker. I first had to reverse engineer the communications protocol and then figure out how to teach this in a way that beginner cs students could understand. 

My favorite languages are Python, C++, and Italian.

I wrote and posted it in both places but I figured I’d also keep it here for historical purposes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming off our recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://fordhamcss.org/events/2021/03/22/hacking-a-coffee-maker.html/&quot;&gt;Hacking a Coffee Maker Event&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to write up a blog post with more technical information about what we did. So here’s kind of a summary of what I discovered about the coffee makers, and if you came to the event, what was actually going on when we were sending messages to our CaaS (Coffee as a Service) server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TLDR;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So very simply, the coffee makers are vulnerable to a replay attack if you can sniff the communication between a phone and the coffee maker when you send a  “brew” message to the coffee maker. You can resend the messages the phone sends in the same order, after a TCP connection is established, and the coffee maker will turn on. I started trying to reverse engineer the binary protocol before I realized this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation for this research stemmed from IoT devices not having the greatest reputation when it comes to security. If you’re unaware about some of the poor decisions that have been made when designing IoT devices, then check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5PRvBpLuJs&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. So anyway, I found these Atomi “Smart” Coffee Makers (When talking about “smart” devices, I feel that “smart” should always be put in quotes) that work over WiFi, and allow you to brew coffee from your phone. So that’s great, TCP/IP, networking, and packet sniffing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to register the smart coffee maker to an Atomi account in order to access the functionality where you can turn it on from a phone. After all, this was my goal. The registration process involved connecting to the WiFi network the coffee maker emits when it’s turned on for the first time from your phone, and then setting some configuration in the Atomi Smart app. I tried to exploit the setup process for this, however I didn’t have too much luck sniffing packets or port scanning the network the coffee maker emits at this stage, although I didn’t spend too much time on this. If I were to look at this again, I would probably launch an Android emulator on my computer to have the Atomi app downloaded, and use Wireshark at this step to sniff the configuration packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved on to the actual “brew coffee from your phone” feature. I setup a Raspberry Pi wireless access point, so I could sniff all traffic that gets sent to and from the coffee maker. This can be done numerous ways but my solution was the Raspberry Pi with PiOS and TCP dump. I also was able to get the packet dump to show nicely on my laptop in Wireshark by using this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh root@raspberrypi tcpdump -i wlan0 -U -s0 -w - 'not port 22' | &quot;C:\Program Files\Wireshark\Wireshark.exe&quot; -k -i -
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After connecting both my phone and the coffee maker to my Raspberry Pi WAP (wireless access point), I was able to see the conversations the coffee maker and phone were sending back and forth when a “brew” message was sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end goal with this setup is to simply learn “How does this device work?”. If you are a security researcher and you’re looking for vulnerabilities in a certain system, if you can understand how the system works, you can isolate the weak points and target your research at those areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;discoveries&quot;&gt;Discoveries&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to start examining what is going on… The messages that do not have an indent before them were sent from my phone to the coffee maker. The ones that are tabbed over were the responses from the coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you’ve never seen any binary messages before you probably have a headache at this point, but let me break down some of these messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first message that the phone sends is a “hello” message. After doing some further testing, I discovered that this message contains some information that is unique to the registration of the coffee maker with your atomi account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first response is also included, but tabbed over. If you notice, there’s a similarity between both of these messages. The first four bytes of both message are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00 00 55 aa&lt;/code&gt; and the last four are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00 00 aa 55&lt;/code&gt;. If you look back at the other messages, you can see this pattern for every single message that gets sent both to and from the coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;00000000  00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 01  00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 58   ..U..... .......X

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few messages appear to be some sort of keep alive messages and responses, however, they can provide some insight into the nature of this communication protocol, since they are so short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;00000068  00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 02  00 00 00 09 00 00 00 08   ..U..... ........

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next four bytes after the start of the message are a message count. If you look at the entire transcript of messages, you’ll notice that this increases by one every time a new message is sent. The next 8 bytes seem to be some kind of message type identifier. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00 00 00 09 00 00 00 08&lt;/code&gt; shows up in both keep alive messages, and is also different for other messages. Those bytes; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00 00 00 09 00 00 00 08&lt;/code&gt; must mean that the message is a keep alive message. The response from the coffee maker gives us a message type of: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00 00 00 09 00 00 00 0c&lt;/code&gt;, so this must mean an “acknowledgement” message of the keep alive from the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 8 bytes left in the keep alive message. We recognize the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00 00 aa 55&lt;/code&gt; as the ending bytes from the opening messages, which leaves us with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;4b 65 24 a4&lt;/code&gt; to figure out. I think this is some sort of checksum message, as these four bytes change in the next keep alive message. I never successfully reverse engineered this checksum value, however if I were to keep researching this, I would first start by capturing about 5 minutes of keep alive messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After these messages comes the most interesting message; the “Brew” message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;00000098  00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 04  00 00 00 07 00 00 00 87   ..U..... ........      &amp;lt;&amp;gt;     This is the

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can observe the patterns from the previous messages here. The start and end bytes; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00 00 55 aa&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00 00 aa 55&lt;/code&gt;. There’s the message count: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00 00 00 04&lt;/code&gt;, and then the “brew” message type: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00 00 00 07 00 00 00 87&lt;/code&gt;. The parts in the middle are some kind of data. I’m unsure what it means but this might be able to be reversed by observing what this message looks like when it’s at different parts in the sequence (I.e. what happens when you send the “brew” message from your phone when it’s the 5th packet in the sequence, 6th, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the messages started to get confusing. At this point, now that I had a basic understanding of what each message did, I started testing sending this data to the coffee maker. I did this with a simple python script that is linked in the original event post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending solely the “brew” message to the coffee maker didn’t turn it on, however, I tried sending all of the client messages in order from python and boom! The coffee maker started brewing. Pwned: ✔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we had multiple coffee makers, I wanted to see what the scope of this replay attack was, and it turns out that something in the first message establishes the TCP connection as a valid TCP connection. Sending that first welcome message to different coffee maker on the network does not produce the “start brewing” result that we are seeking. This is where the coffee maker is actually more secure than I thought it might be. In order to turn on the coffee maker by sending network packets from python, you need to know the values in that original first message that establishes the communication as valid. The only way (I know of) doing this is by sniffing the communication between your phone and the coffee maker. If someone was in a position to do this on your home network, you may have bigger issues than your coffee maker magically turning on at 3 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another observation I made when testing was in regards to the “WiFi” button on the physical coffee maker. There’s a button on the front panel that when unlit, disables all of the remote coffee functions. Naturally, you might think that this would disable the wireless card and disconnect the coffee maker from the network, however this is not the case. The WiFi button simply disables the firmware on the microcontroller from interacting with the coffee maker. If you’ve disabled the WiFi with the button, the coffee maker still accepts network requests and sends back the same data, however it doesn’t turn the coffee maker on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I stopped trying to reverse the coffee maker, because I had enough substance to run our CSS event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there is a replay attack vulnerability that allows you to successfully turn on one of these coffee makers from python while the coffee maker is on a network. However, they have some security features that limit its scope to the messages that were sent to and from one specific coffee maker to a phone. There’s definitely more that can be researched and if I were to continue researching this, I would sniff many more diverse phone-to-coffee maker conversations (such as a lengthy keep-alive sequence, and selecting “brew” at different points in the conversation to see how the checksums differ, etc) and further attempt to reverse engineer the binary protocol so that I could craft my own coffee maker packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was pretty much how the event worked (aside from exposing the coffee makers to the public internet so people who were remote at the event possibly could have recreated this behavior….). Thanks to all who came to the event, and I hope you were able to learn something about embedded devices!&lt;/p&gt;

I wrote and posted it in both places but I figured I’d also keep it here for historical purposes Coming off our recent Hacking a Coffee Maker Event, I wanted to write up a blog post with more technical information about what we did. So here’s kind of a summary of what I discovered about the coffee makers, and if you came to the event, what was actually going on when we were sending messages to our CaaS (Coffee as a Service) server. TLDR; So very simply, the coffee makers are vulnerable to a replay attack if you can sniff the communication between a phone and the coffee maker when you send a “brew” message to the coffee maker. You can resend the messages the phone sends in the same order, after a TCP connection is established, and the coffee maker will turn on. I started trying to reverse engineer the binary protocol before I realized this. Background Motivation The motivation for this research stemmed from IoT devices not having the greatest reputation when it comes to security. If you’re unaware about some of the poor decisions that have been made when designing IoT devices, then check out this. So anyway, I found these Atomi “Smart” Coffee Makers (When talking about “smart” devices, I feel that “smart” should always be put in quotes) that work over WiFi, and allow you to brew coffee from your phone. So that’s great, TCP/IP, networking, and packet sniffing! Setup I had to register the smart coffee maker to an Atomi account in order to access the functionality where you can turn it on from a phone. After all, this was my goal. The registration process involved connecting to the WiFi network the coffee maker emits when it’s turned on for the first time from your phone, and then setting some configuration in the Atomi Smart app. I tried to exploit the setup process for this, however I didn’t have too much luck sniffing packets or port scanning the network the coffee maker emits at this stage, although I didn’t spend too much time on this. If I were to look at this again, I would probably launch an Android emulator on my computer to have the Atomi app downloaded, and use Wireshark at this step to sniff the configuration packets. I moved on to the actual “brew coffee from your phone” feature. I setup a Raspberry Pi wireless access point, so I could sniff all traffic that gets sent to and from the coffee maker. This can be done numerous ways but my solution was the Raspberry Pi with PiOS and TCP dump. I also was able to get the packet dump to show nicely on my laptop in Wireshark by using this command: ssh root@raspberrypi tcpdump -i wlan0 -U -s0 -w - 'not port 22' | &quot;C:\Program Files\Wireshark\Wireshark.exe&quot; -k -i - After connecting both my phone and the coffee maker to my Raspberry Pi WAP (wireless access point), I was able to see the conversations the coffee maker and phone were sending back and forth when a “brew” message was sent. The end goal with this setup is to simply learn “How does this device work?”. If you are a security researcher and you’re looking for vulnerabilities in a certain system, if you can understand how the system works, you can isolate the weak points and target your research at those areas. Discoveries Now to start examining what is going on… The messages that do not have an indent before them were sent from my phone to the coffee maker. The ones that are tabbed over were the responses from the coffee maker. 00000000 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 58 ..U..... .......X 00000010 df e8 53 b4 31 f5 9e 52 0c 95 a0 db be 60 64 a2 ..S.1..R .....`d. 00000020 19 59 a3 1d f6 78 8d 71 da d4 33 40 08 3a 16 38 .Y...x.q ..3@.:.8 00000030 90 4c 1a 03 a0 5c b1 bd 79 d4 e0 d6 67 22 91 95 .L...\.. y...g&quot;.. 00000040 19 59 a3 1d f6 78 8d 71 da d4 33 40 08 3a 16 38 .Y...x.q ..3@.:.8 00000050 39 29 02 a5 50 92 1e 67 df 43 ff df ee b0 89 01 9)..P..g .C...... 00000060 d0 59 17 5f 00 00 aa 55 .Y._...U 00000000 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 2c ..U..... ......., 00000010 00 00 00 01 aa 05 53 2e e0 13 aa ab e2 7b 0c 31 ......S. .....{.1 00000020 fe fc e9 17 e0 18 e9 31 f2 05 86 09 e7 b1 75 55 .......1 ......uU 00000030 d2 29 34 47 1c c3 81 68 00 00 aa 55 .)4G...h ...U 00000068 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 08 ..U..... ........ 00000078 4b 65 24 a4 00 00 aa 55 Ke$....U 0000003C 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 0c ..U..... ........ 0000004C 00 00 00 00 b0 51 ab 03 00 00 aa 55 .....Q.. ...U 00000080 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 08 ..U..... ........ 00000090 5c 1e 30 e7 00 00 aa 55 \.0....U 00000058 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 0c ..U..... ........ 00000068 00 00 00 00 b0 51 ab 03 00 00 aa 55 .....Q.. ...U 00000098 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 07 00 00 00 87 ..U..... ........ &amp;lt;&amp;gt; This is the 000000A8 33 2e 33 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 01 72 f4 e0 fb 3.3..... ....r... &amp;lt;&amp;gt; message that 000000B8 c5 a4 be bf 3d 35 28 61 8e ca 37 fb c3 bd 51 aa ....=5(a ..7...Q. &amp;lt;&amp;gt; ######### tells the 000000C8 62 51 89 70 c5 7f 52 89 67 4d b6 77 78 83 6f fa bQ.p..R. gM.wx.o. &amp;lt;&amp;gt; coffee maker 000000D8 4f 32 40 dd a3 1f d4 17 a4 cb 38 b7 8f 7c 0b 6e O2@..... ..8..|.n &amp;lt;&amp;gt; to turn on 000000E8 2b e4 c4 42 de 3e 0f c7 95 09 56 7a d8 03 ac e7 +..B.&amp;gt;.. ..Vz.... 000000F8 d1 dd 48 a1 f0 b9 a4 c3 17 d2 7d b5 8d 29 6b 00 ..H..... ..}..)k. 00000108 34 31 f6 7b ea c6 a4 28 b1 a8 85 e8 00 7f 78 e8 41.{...( ......x. 00000118 dd 48 be 84 9b 05 1c a9 14 de eb 34 96 a9 44 e3 .H...... ...4..D. 00000128 36 36 6a 00 00 aa 55 66j...U 00000074 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 07 00 00 00 0c ..U..... ........ 00000084 00 00 00 00 b8 2a 1a 07 00 00 aa 55 .....*.. ...U 00000090 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 08 00 00 00 4b ..U..... .......K 000000A0 00 00 00 00 33 2e 33 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 29 00 ....3.3. ......). 000000B0 00 00 01 fb c5 a4 be bf 3d 35 28 61 8e ca 37 fb ........ =5(a..7. 000000C0 c3 bd 51 f9 03 10 4b 91 31 ef 75 ef 00 4c f7 61 ..Q...K. 1.u..L.a 000000D0 41 3f 1b e8 dd 48 be 84 9b 05 1c a9 14 de eb 34 A?...H.. .......4 000000E0 96 a9 44 e5 93 7d 50 00 00 aa 55 00 00 55 aa 00 ..D..}P. ..U..U.. 000000F0 00 00 00 00 00 00 08 00 00 00 4b 00 00 00 00 33 ........ ..K....3 00000100 2e 33 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2a 00 00 00 01 f5 31 .3...... .*.....1 00000110 e0 e8 c3 66 57 a6 f8 82 3e ce 5f 69 0c 4d 36 e5 ...fW... &amp;gt;._i.M6. 00000120 b4 4d ce 97 b2 27 16 56 78 de 1e ee c5 ce 51 c7 .M...'.V x.....Q. 00000130 ac 34 bf 9d 24 37 f9 66 7d 24 b7 25 11 f1 cb 9e .4..$7.f }$.%.... 00000140 86 24 00 00 aa 55 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 00 00 00 .$...U..

The first message that the phone sends is a “hello” message. After doing some further testing, I discovered that this message contains some information that is unique to the registration of the coffee maker with your atomi account. The first response is also included, but tabbed over. If you notice, there’s a similarity between both of these messages. The first four bytes of both message are 00 00 55 aa and the last four are 00 00 aa 55. If you look back at the other messages, you can see this pattern for every single message that gets sent both to and from the coffee maker. 00000000 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 58 ..U..... .......X 00000010 df e8 53 b4 31 f5 9e 52 0c 95 a0 db be 60 64 a2 ..S.1..R .....`d. 00000020 19 59 a3 1d f6 78 8d 71 da d4 33 40 08 3a 16 38 .Y...x.q ..3@.:.8 00000030 90 4c 1a 03 a0 5c b1 bd 79 d4 e0 d6 67 22 91 95 .L...\.. y...g&quot;.. 00000040 19 59 a3 1d f6 78 8d 71 da d4 33 40 08 3a 16 38 .Y...x.q ..3@.:.8 00000050 39 29 02 a5 50 92 1e 67 df 43 ff df ee b0 89 01 9)..P..g .C...... 00000060 d0 59 17 5f 00 00 aa 55 00000000 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 2c ..U..... ......., 00000010 00 00 00 01 aa 05 53 2e e0 13 aa ab e2 7b 0c 31 ......S. .....{.1 00000020 fe fc e9 17 e0 18 e9 31 f2 05 86 09 e7 b1 75 55 .......1 ......uU 00000030 d2 29 34 47 1c c3 81 68 00 00 aa 55 .)4G...h ...U The next few messages appear to be some sort of keep alive messages and responses, however, they can provide some insight into the nature of this communication protocol, since they are so short. 00000068 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 08 ..U..... ........ 00000078 4b 65 24 a4 00 00 aa 55 Ke$....U 0000003C 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 0c ..U..... ........ 0000004C 00 00 00 00 b0 51 ab 03 00 00 aa 55 .....Q.. ...U 00000080 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 08 ..U..... ........ 00000090 5c 1e 30 e7 00 00 aa 55 \.0....U 00000058 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 0c ..U..... ........ 00000068 00 00 00 00 b0 51 ab 03 00 00 aa 55 .....Q.. ...U The next four bytes after the start of the message are a message count. If you look at the entire transcript of messages, you’ll notice that this increases by one every time a new message is sent. The next 8 bytes seem to be some kind of message type identifier. 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 08 shows up in both keep alive messages, and is also different for other messages. Those bytes; 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 08 must mean that the message is a keep alive message. The response from the coffee maker gives us a message type of: 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 0c, so this must mean an “acknowledgement” message of the keep alive from the phone. There are 8 bytes left in the keep alive message. We recognize the 00 00 aa 55 as the ending bytes from the opening messages, which leaves us with 4b 65 24 a4 to figure out. I think this is some sort of checksum message, as these four bytes change in the next keep alive message. I never successfully reverse engineered this checksum value, however if I were to keep researching this, I would first start by capturing about 5 minutes of keep alive messages. After these messages comes the most interesting message; the “Brew” message. 00000098 00 00 55 aa 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 07 00 00 00 87 ..U..... ........ &amp;lt;&amp;gt; This is the 000000A8 33 2e 33 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 01 72 f4 e0 fb 3.3..... ....r... &amp;lt;&amp;gt; message that 000000B8 c5 a4 be bf 3d 35 28 61 8e ca 37 fb c3 bd 51 aa ....=5(a ..7...Q. &amp;lt;&amp;gt; ######### tells the 000000C8 62 51 89 70 c5 7f 52 89 67 4d b6 77 78 83 6f fa bQ.p..R. gM.wx.o. &amp;lt;&amp;gt; coffee maker 000000D8 4f 32 40 dd a3 1f d4 17 a4 cb 38 b7 8f 7c 0b 6e O2@..... ..8..|.n &amp;lt;&amp;gt; to turn on 000000E8 2b e4 c4 42 de 3e 0f c7 95 09 56 7a d8 03 ac e7 +..B.&amp;gt;.. ..Vz.... 000000F8 d1 dd 48 a1 f0 b9 a4 c3 17 d2 7d b5 8d 29 6b 00 ..H..... ..}..)k. 00000108 34 31 f6 7b ea c6 a4 28 b1 a8 85 e8 00 7f 78 e8 41.{...( ......x. 00000118 dd 48 be 84 9b 05 1c a9 14 de eb 34 96 a9 44 e3 .H...... ...4..D. 00000128 36 36 6a 00 00 aa 55 You can observe the patterns from the previous messages here. The start and end bytes; 00 00 55 aa, and 00 00 aa 55. There’s the message count: 00 00 00 04, and then the “brew” message type: 00 00 00 07 00 00 00 87. The parts in the middle are some kind of data. I’m unsure what it means but this might be able to be reversed by observing what this message looks like when it’s at different parts in the sequence (I.e. what happens when you send the “brew” message from your phone when it’s the 5th packet in the sequence, 6th, etc) This is where the messages started to get confusing. At this point, now that I had a basic understanding of what each message did, I started testing sending this data to the coffee maker. I did this with a simple python script that is linked in the original event post. Sending solely the “brew” message to the coffee maker didn’t turn it on, however, I tried sending all of the client messages in order from python and boom! The coffee maker started brewing. Pwned: ✔ Since we had multiple coffee makers, I wanted to see what the scope of this replay attack was, and it turns out that something in the first message establishes the TCP connection as a valid TCP connection. Sending that first welcome message to different coffee maker on the network does not produce the “start brewing” result that we are seeking. This is where the coffee maker is actually more secure than I thought it might be. In order to turn on the coffee maker by sending network packets from python, you need to know the values in that original first message that establishes the communication as valid. The only way (I know of) doing this is by sniffing the communication between your phone and the coffee maker. If someone was in a position to do this on your home network, you may have bigger issues than your coffee maker magically turning on at 3 am. Another observation I made when testing was in regards to the “WiFi” button on the physical coffee maker. There’s a button on the front panel that when unlit, disables all of the remote coffee functions. Naturally, you might think that this would disable the wireless card and disconnect the coffee maker from the network, however this is not the case. The WiFi button simply disables the firmware on the microcontroller from interacting with the coffee maker. If you’ve disabled the WiFi with the button, the coffee maker still accepts network requests and sends back the same data, however it doesn’t turn the coffee maker on. At this point, I stopped trying to reverse the coffee maker, because I had enough substance to run our CSS event. Conclusion In conclusion, there is a replay attack vulnerability that allows you to successfully turn on one of these coffee makers from python while the coffee maker is on a network. However, they have some security features that limit its scope to the messages that were sent to and from one specific coffee maker to a phone. There’s definitely more that can be researched and if I were to continue researching this, I would sniff many more diverse phone-to-coffee maker conversations (such as a lengthy keep-alive sequence, and selecting “brew” at different points in the conversation to see how the checksums differ, etc) and further attempt to reverse engineer the binary protocol so that I could craft my own coffee maker packets. This was pretty much how the event worked (aside from exposing the coffee makers to the public internet so people who were remote at the event possibly could have recreated this behavior….). Thanks to all who came to the event, and I hope you were able to learn something about embedded devices! newlines go</summary></entry></feed>
